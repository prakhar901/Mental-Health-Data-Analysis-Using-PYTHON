# Mental-Health-Data-Analysis-Using-PYTHON
 Mental illness is a health problem that undoubtedly impacts emotions, reasoning, and social interaction of a person. These issues have shown that mental illness gives serious consequences across societies and demands new strategies for prevention and intervention. To accomplish these strategies, early detection of mental health is an essential procedure. Medical predictive analytics will reform the healthcare field broadly as discussed by Miner et al. [1]. Mental illness is usually diagnosed based on the individual self-report that requires questionnaires designed for the detection of the specific patterns of feeling or social interactions [2]. With proper care and treatment, many individuals will hopefully be able to recover from mental illness or emotional disorder  
Machine learning is a technique that aims to construct systems that can improve through experience by using advanced statistical and probabilistic techniques. It is believed to be a significantly useful tool to help in predicting mental health. It is allowing many researchers to acquire important information from the data, provide personalized experiences, and develop automated intelligent systems [4]. The widely used algorithms in the field of machine learning such as support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural networks have been utilized to forecast and categorize the future events

OBJECTIVE 
This review aimed to provide a concise snapshot of the research to date investigating ML applications to mental health. Previous reviews have demonstrated ML techniques to be robust and scalable for mental health application, but no review has comprehensively mapped the clinical applications within mental health research and practice. Such a review would equip both data scientists and practitioners in the methods and applications of big data. It would also highlight the challenges of using ML techniques in this context, as well as identify gaps in the field and potential opportunities for further research. First, we outline the search strategies used to find relevant literature. Next, we conduct a synthesis of the literature, describing both the ML techniques and mental health applications of each article. Finally, the paper summarises the extant research and the implications for future work.  

CONCLUSION : 
Above is the report of the project with data preprocessing , training and test data , feature engineering etc .We have used logistic regression,k neighbour,dicission tree classification-based algorithm .accuracy of all algos comes out to be 79.63%,80.42%,80.69%
